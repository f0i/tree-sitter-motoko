## tree-sitter-motoko

Here you can find my attempt to reflect the [Motoko](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko) grammar into tree-sitter. Motoko is the language of the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/), a web3 platform that serves HTTP requests through distributed, containerized applications called canisters.

The grammar used in this reflection is found [here](https://github.com/dfinity/motoko/blob/b8f76986b4f6b1556569c72decab3f7381bc6cdc/doc/md/examples/grammar.txt).

### why

- I want to understand the Motoko language.
- There is no tree-sitter grammar.
